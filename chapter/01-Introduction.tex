\chapter{Introduction}
The thesis or dissertation must be a document of the best professional standards. It is also good practice for the student to prepare a document that meets the criteria for publication in the relevant professional journals. As the original copy of the thesis or dissertation will be kept in the University Libraries, and copied for microfilming and other purposes, the paper and the production must conform to standards of long archive life and clear reproducibility. In addition, an electronic copy of the thesis or dissertation is required by the College of Engineering for archiving by the department. These instructions provide a guide for the production of a high-quality thesis or dissertation document, and formatting specifications to ensure some basic consistency among engineering theses and dissertations. It is the responsibility of the student to see that these guidelines are met, and the responsibility of the department to confirm this before submitting the thesis or dissertation to the College of Engineering Dean for approval. While preparing your thesis or dissertation the guidelines in the booklet, Publishing Your Doctoral Dissertation with UMI Dissertation Publishing, provided by ProQuest/UMI should be followed. Download a copy of this booklet, or obtain it from the department's graduate coordinator. Other requirements specific to the college are provided below. \cite{einstein}


\section{Submission Procedure}

The College of Engineering requires that all theses and dissertations be submitted to both the Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Repository and the ProQuest ETD Administrator Repository. This submission is completed through the ProQuest ETD Administrator website.

\subsection{ProQuest}

ProQuest offers two publishing options: \textit{Traditional Publishing} and \textit{Open Access Publishing PLUS}. Under all publishing options, students retain the copyright to their work. For an additional fee, ProQuest can officially register the student’s copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office. While registration is not required to maintain copyright ownership, it may provide certain legal benefits. For more information, students should consult the UMI Copyright Guide.

\subsubsection{Traditional Publishing}

Under the Traditional Publishing option, students enter into an agreement granting ProQuest a non-exclusive license to publish the abstract and to duplicate and distribute the dissertation. The abstract, bibliography, and other metadata of the thesis or dissertation will be included in the \textit{ProQuest Dissertations and Theses} (PQDT) database. ProQuest pays authors a 10\% royalty on any sales of their work.

\subsubsection{Open Access Publishing through ProQuest PLUS}

Under the Open Access Publishing PLUS option, students enter into an agreement granting ProQuest a non-exclusive license to publish their work in the \textit{ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Open Database} and make it available for free download. Students do not receive royalties under this option. A one-time upfront fee is required. Additional information on Open Access Publishing PLUS is available on the ProQuest website.

\subsection{Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Repository}

During the ProQuest ETD Administrator submission process, students are required to publish their thesis or dissertation in the Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Repository. This repository, supported by the University Libraries, provides online open access to scholarly work produced by Carnegie Mellon University faculty and students. Students may choose to restrict access to campus-only (archival) access. There is no fee for submission.

Publishing a thesis or dissertation in the Institutional Repository does not affect authorial copyright ownership. All approved embargo options will be honored.

\subsection{Embargo Options}

An embargo allows the release of a thesis or dissertation to be delayed for a limited period of time. Embargos are commonly requested due to pending patents, the inclusion of material that cannot be released because of copyright restrictions, or the intention to publish all or part of the work in a journal or book.

\subsection{Supplementary Materials}

Supplementary materials, such as raw data underlying the research, should be uploaded during the ProQuest ETD Administrator submission process. These materials will be made available online with the thesis or dissertation in the Institutional Repository, or provided on a CD or DVD if a printed copy is requested.

\subsection{Departmental Copies}

The thesis or dissertation may also be archived by the department on a non-public server. In some departments, authors may have the option to post the thesis or dissertation on a publicly accessible website maintained by the department. Students should consult their departmental handbook for specific policies and requirements.


\section{Required Documentation}

The following documents must be submitted to the College of Engineering Graduate School in addition to the electronic submission of the thesis or dissertation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A PDF of the completed thesis or dissertation
    \item A Signature Page, signed by the advisor(s) and Department Head(s)
    \item A Committee Page, signed by all committee members
    \item A Submission Checklist confirming proper document formatting and the copyright assertion decision
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Signature Page}

Separate from the PDF of the thesis or dissertation, a Signature Page is required and must follow the format specified for regular degrees and joint degrees. The original Signature Page must be signed by the thesis or dissertation advisor(s), the Department Head, and the Dean or Associate Dean for Graduate and Faculty Affairs of the College of Engineering. Only one original Signature Page should accompany the thesis or dissertation submitted to the Department Head and Dean for review and approval.

\subsection{Committee Page}

Separate from the PDF of the thesis or dissertation, a Committee Page is required. The original Committee Page must be signed by all committee members for doctoral works and by all readers for master’s works.

\subsection{Submission Checklist}

Separate from the PDF of the thesis or dissertation, a Submission Checklist is required. The checklist must be carefully reviewed to ensure that all submission requirements have been satisfied. The Submission Checklist must be completed and signed by the student.
